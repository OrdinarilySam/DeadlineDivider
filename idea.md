# Progress
## Future

Now that the application works, my main goal will be to update the styling and look of the website. This branch will focus on doing that while implementing some quality of life improvements

## Style

- Find a font and update the typography everywhere
- Find a color scheme and update the coloring everywhere
- - The buttons should remain green, the today button should remain orange. 
I like how the the inputs turn transparent once you've entered a value, but 
- Add and delete value buttons should be inverted so the red is the background and white is the text color
- And the green one will be green background

## QOL

- Pushing new value button auto focuses on new value
- Hitting enter on the input field will create a new input field
- Clicking the green button will not

## Features
- New value btn will disappear on submit
- First input is forced and hardcoded in html

- Reset button that will turn all the values back into inputs
- If all values are inputs, reset will delete all values
- Weekend checkbox to include weekends in time calculations
- Comes pre equipped with a value input that cannot be deleted
- (maybe) Sections can be named
- (maybe) An info page explaining how to use it
- - Just update the readme maybe?

## Organization

- (maybe) Find out how to put some functions in other files to keep the main script file clean
