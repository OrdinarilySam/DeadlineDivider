# DeadlineDivider
The Deadline Divider is a little website you can use to cut deadlines down to a minimum amount per day. 

### Instructions
Simply enter your starting and ending dates and type in the values (these could be homework problems, pages to read, minutes of videos to watch, etc.) and click submit. Deadline Divider will find out how much you need to do per day to finish on the specified end date and then will tell you how long it will take you to complete each section.
